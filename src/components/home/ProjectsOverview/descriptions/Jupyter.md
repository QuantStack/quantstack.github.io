Our team is deeply involved in the development of the Jupyter project, at both technical and organizational levels, with several members participating in the project governance in various capacities.

We are responsible for some of the main innovations of the past years (JupyterLite, Collaborative editing in JupyterLab, the Voilà dashboard system, the JupyterLab visual debugger).
