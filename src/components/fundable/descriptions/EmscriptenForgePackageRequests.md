#### Overview
Emscripten-forge is a conda package distribution specifically designed for WebAssembly. When combined with JupyterLite and the jupyterlite-xeus extension, it enables easy deployment of JupyterLite with a preconfigured conda environment that includes essential packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more.

While the number of available emscripten-forge packages is growing quickly, many packages are still missing from the ecosystem.

We will be working on adding new packages upon request.
