Projects developed at QuantStack have reached millions of end users,
from healthcare to education, from aerospace to geosciences, and
from data sciences to robotics.

Open-source development is a unique
way to break down collaboration barriers and reach users with
unexpected use cases. Enabling customisation and extensions of the
tools enables this diversity of applications.
